    <h1>Call for Workshop Proposals </h1> <br> 
         
    2023  IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine  <br>
    <a href="https://ieeebibm.org/BIBM2023/"></a> <br>
    December 5-8, 2023, Istanbul Turkey
      <br><br>
    <center>=================================================================</center> <br><br>
    The Program Committees of the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (IEEE BIBM 2023) invite proposals for Workshops.  Selected workshops will hold a central position within the larger Conference, which will bring together top academic and industrial researchers from all over the world to exchange cutting edge research ideas in bioinformatics and biomedicine.  Within these fields, workshops at BIBM form crucial focal points for emerging communities and forums for the examination of new ideas.
    Workshop organizers will be responsible for advertising the workshop, forming the program committees, reviewing and selecting the papers, and guaranteeing a high quality worthy of the prestige and breadth of the Conference.  All papers accepted for workshops will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference. 
            <br>
    The workshop organizers will also have the discretion of editing selected papers (after their expansion and revision) into books or special journal issues.  Workshops should cover at least a single session (8 regular papers). The workshop organizers should ensure registration and presence of   authors of accepted papers. <br><br>
            
    <h2>Workshop Topics</h2> <br>
    Each workshop subject will focus on new research challenges and initiatives in Bioinformatics,  Biomedicine and Healthcare Informatics.  The workshops should provide an informal and vibrant forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their research results and practical development experiences in these three fields.  Workshop topics may be narrow, e.g., “reverse-engineering” of  gene regulatory networks from experimental data, computational approaches to drug discovery, mathematical modeling of signaling pathways, analysis of the next-generation sequencing data, oscillations and synchronization of biological rhythms, wireless sensor networks, patient health records, medical signal processing; or broad, e.g., computational proteomics, in-silico diagnosis and prognosis, data mining and machine learning algorithms for biomedical applications, application of network research to biology, emerging technology in healthcare, aging research etc.  Prospective workshop organizers are encouraged to contact workshop chairs for feedback. <br>
